Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a type of deep learning model that excels at handling [sequential data](https://mostly.ai/synthetic-data-dictionary/sequential-data#:~:text=Sequential%20data%20is%20data%20arranged,of%20numbers%20with%20a%20pattern.).

Unlike traditional neural networks where inputs are independent, RNNs have internal memory that allows them to process information from previous inputs and use it to influence the output for current inputs. This makes them particularly useful for tasks that involve sequences, like:

* Language translation
* Speech recognition
* Time series forecasting
